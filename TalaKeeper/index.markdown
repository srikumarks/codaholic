[Tala Keeper] is a programmable visual metronome for practicing music with time
structures beyond the conventional bar/beat structure supported by conventional
analog and digital metronomes or their simulations. In particular, Tala Keeper
is suited for the [T훮las of Carnatic music] and perhaps the 
[Usuls of Turkish Mak훮m music].
