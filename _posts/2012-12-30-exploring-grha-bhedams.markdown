Here is a demo web app for exploring [rāgās and their bhēdams].

A few weeks ago, I had a conversation with Mr. Ramesh who showed me
some amazing Excel wizardry and spells he'd cast to be able to take
a raga and ask questions about its [graha bhēdams]. I hadn't realized
until then that the question of what the scales of ragas turn into 
when you do bhēdams on them (graha or śruti bhēdam) involves a rather
non-trivial mental transformation, though one that is pretty simple 
to do on a computer. So I resurrected a rāgā database that I'd scraped 
off Wikipedia's [Janya Rāgās] page some 4 years ago and made this 
[bhēdam explorer] web app.

The app could use some visual love, but it serves the exploratory
purpose as it stands. Have fun with it!
