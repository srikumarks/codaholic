I gave a talk titled "Mathemusicking with children: Doing math and music
without telling them apart" at the [C. R. Rao Advanced Institute for
Mathematics Statistics and Computer Science][crraimscs] on 14 March 2015, as
part of a workshop on [Math, music and nature][mmn].

[Slides of my talk](http://sriku.org/talks/mathemusicking/slides.pdf) (PDF)

The talk was about the summer of 2014 workshop on music and math for children
that I co-conducted along with Mrs. Usha Narasimhan, at [Brhaddhvani][brh],
Chennai.

There was a request from the audience for the "Melakarta pathways" picture.
[Here is a PDF][mpath] you can print out. There are exactly 72 ways to traverse
from the S at the left to the S at the right. Each path you take corresponds to
a scale of the Melakarta system.
