The term "object oriented programming" has degraded to the point where I no
longer take self proclaimed OOP enthusiasts seriously. I don't believe they
know what they're talking about ... unless they bring up something ... anything
... about Smalltalk. If you don't have a clue about what makes me go soft upon
the mere mention of Smalltalk, check out this 1987 video demo of the 
[Alternate Reality Kit]. Makes you wish you had that on an iPad today doesn't it?
