I saw "Gravity" today. You've made a really engaging film that made me want to
watch it again. What made me a little sad is that this was such a wonderful
opportunity for you to have made your mark in film-making history. No, I'm not
talking about the usual physics nitpicks, but the squandered opportunity of
making and releasing this film in HFR 3D ... in IMax.

First, who am I to say this? Nobody. Just a movie buff who loves great story
telling and cinematography.

So ... why do I say that this movie ought to have been released in HFR 3D?

When "The Hobbit" was released, I saw it in IMax HFR 3D and in normal 3D.  I
made [a few observations](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5034584) about
what my experience of "The Hobbit" in HFR 3D was like back then. As I revisit
that list today after watching "Gravity", I'm blown away by the missed
opportunity at making film history. I'll walk through some of those points
again here in the context of "Gravity".

Despite being set in space, the story of Gravity draws the viewer to be
intimate with the main characters - to see, hear and feel what they're going
through. The indoor scenes in The Hobbit, for me, had that level of intimacy
with the characters. Gravity could've capitalized on this effect to have 10x
the impact it already has.

Well, there *is* no air in space to feel in *this* movie. Based on how it felt
in The Hobbit, I'd expect the camera movement through space to feel ... well,
like a camera moving through space. Furthermore, there is little "motion blur"
at 48fps compared to 24fps and the motion really feels closer to the fidelity
at which we experience such motion. Just the higher frame rate alone, I think,
would've made all the spinning waaaaay more engaging and would've drawn the
audience to feel the characters deeper.

As I said above, the setting of Gravity calls on the audience to be intimate
with the characters. With HFR 3D, you could've gone the last remaining mile and
cut down on the background score, paying closer attention to the in-space-suit
and in-capsule sounds ... which are already pretty good in the current version
(kudos!).  Losing the background score, I predict, would enhance the drama 10x
in the HFR 3D version. The "fly in to Sandra Bullock's visor" scene was
beautiful -- beginning outside and slowly coming to see what she's seeing,
until she settles down.  Even simply imagining what this would feel like in HFR
3D makes me go "wow". I would *love* to see it.

The environment of space is so alien to practically everyone on the planet that
I bet many (like me) would pay premium to feel that little bit extra closer to
what the astronauts feel.

So ... please hear my plea and make/remake/re-release this film in HFR 3D.  ..
But don't just change the format. Do the right thing for that format. In
addition to being the first HFR 3D film to be "done right", maybe "Gravity"
will inspire another generation of astronauts.
