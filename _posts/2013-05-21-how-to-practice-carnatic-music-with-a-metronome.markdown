An essential aspect of the training of a student of Carnatic music is an
internalization of the flow of musical time, known as "layam". Though the adage
"sruti mata, laya pitah" ("the tonic is the mother and time is the father") is
oft repeated, what we find in practice is that a reference for the sruti
(tonic) is recommended for and always used by even beginner students, but a
comparable reference for time in the form of a metronome is almost never seen.
Many teachers also recommend that students don't practice with a metronome
because of its "robotic" quality. Despite this traditional lower status of a
metronome, many masters of the genre have benefited from its use. 

In this article series, I present various aspects of layam in Carnatic music
from the perspective of a student of the melodic aspect of the genre, and
examine how practice with a metronome might contribute to your -- the student's
-- development in these aspects. I also present what I believe to be the right
mindset to adopt when practicing with a metronome.

I begin the series with "part 1" where I present a simple exercise to
demonstrate the usage of a metronome to internalize the flow of musical time in
a simple context. Though there is nothing specific to Carnatic music in part 1,
the notion of internalizing musical time and the meditative nature of the music
of the genre are stood at the forefront.

## What is a metronome?

A metronome is, broadly speaking, a device that serves as a reference for
musical time, much like a clock is for physical time.  Common metronomes used
in western classical music training include the mechanical metronome which
produces a periodic ticking sound produced by a vertical pendulum, and the
digital metronome that can count beat groups of threes, fours, fives and such.
The digital metronomes usually produce two sounds - one for the first beat of
the group and another for the remaining beats. 

You can read about [the various kinds of metronomes on Wikipedia], so this
article will not delve further into the details or history of the device
itself. The focus of this article is how to practice Carnatic music using
any one of them. If you are unfamiliar with a metronome, please do take 
some time to go through the linked Wikipedia article.

## Tala Keeper

[Tala Keeper] is a metronome I designed with special consideration for the
practice needs of Carnatic music students - both basic and advanced. So I'll
be using Tala Keeper to illustrate cases in this article. Though it is an iOS
app, a [browser-based simulator] is freely available if you don't own an iDevice.

## Beginning at the beginning

{% pullquote %} 
The purpose of practicing Carnatic music with a metronome is
to develop a strong *internal* sense of the flow of musical time, or "layam".
This point is central to practicing Carnatic music with a metronome. To put
it differently, the purpose of practicing with a metronome is not to gain its
mechanical precision, but to develop awareness and control over your internal
sense of time. To give an analogy, we all breathe naturally, but we do it so
automatically and without awareness that a simple question like "how many
breaths do you take in a minute?" can stump us. {" To truly practice (singing or
instrument playing) with a metronome is to turn your attention to your
breathing. "}

## A simple starting exercise using Tala Keeper

To give a taste of what it is like to practice "layam internalization" using a
metronome, here is a simple exercise involving basic tonal production that most
anyone can do.

1. Find a quiet spot, sit comfortably and play a simple left-right bounce
   pattern in Tala Keeper.  To do this, you tap the pads in the following
   sequence -- left-middle-middle-middle-right-middle-middle-middle. Also make
   sure that the [pulse options] control looks like this - ![sound and
   bounce](/images/pulse-sound-bounce.png). 
   
   If you don't have Tala Keeper, you can [open this link][1] in a new browser
   window to play this pattern. A tempo of 60-70 beats per minute is a good
   starting point. With Tala Keeper, the process of internalization already
   began in a small way when you tapped out the sequence as indicated above.
     
   Pay attention to your breathing in relation to the bouncing ball. Feel free
   to adjust the tempo a little to a value that you feel comfortable with. 

   The purpose of this exercise is to not breathe synchronously with the
   bounces (though that is ok too) but to let your breathing proceed naturally,
   while you pay attention to both your breathing as well as the bounces.  When
   done right, this will quickly take you into a meditative state conducive for
   music practice. It will also give you a sense of what your "natural
   breathing" is, so that you can come back to it repeatedly during practice. 

2. After you've adjusted your breathing this way, sing a steady tone in
   "akaara" (a continuous "aah" vowel sound) at a pitch and volume level
   comfortable for you. Look for an effortless and soft tone. Do not concern
   yourself about your "sruti" at this point. Feel not only the duration of the
   note you produce but also the silence that follows during your inhalation,
   before the next note. Do not exert up to the very last ounce of your breath.
   A tone that feels like it is vibrating in your belly is ideal. When singing,
   you may want to choose a slightly higher tempo than your "natural" value to
   accommodate the extra breath effort required.

   At this point, every pulse is both audible as short knocking sounds as well
   as visible through the bouncing of the ball, so you can use this to engage
   both your auditory and visual senses.

3. Now feel this rhythm in your body by moving your hand like the bouncing
   ball. You can pretend to be a conductor waving his/her baton. You do not
   have to be exact, just imitate the way the timing feels using hand gestures.
   Feel free to make subtle or exaggerated gestures.  Continue to attend to
   your breathing. Do this for as long as you feel like. 
   
   At this point, you're experiencing the flow of metric time in three modes -
   auditory, visual and kinesthetic - in an integrated way.

4. Once you're satisfied with the previous phase, expand your consciousness of
   the four beat cycle by turning off visual hints of each pulse. If you're
   using Tala Keeper, you can tap the [pulse options] control till it looks
   like this - ![nobounce](/images/pulse-sound-nobounce.png). In this mode, the
   ball won't bounce in the middle for each pulse, but the "knock" sound will
   be heard.  (If you're following this without Tala Keeper, [click here][2].)

   This is a first step towards internalizing the pulses. You now have auditory
   cues to which you can move your hands (both, or just one to start with) to
   feel the pulses, but you now have to imagine the movement of time between
   pulses. Don't worry if you don't "perfectly" land on the knock sounds. The
   important part is that your attention is on your breathing and the steady
   passage of metric time.

5. Once you feel comfortable with using the auditory cue alone, shift your attention
   to the long bounce of the ball between major beats. The ball will now be doing
   one bounce for every four pulses. Again, pay attention to your breathing, but
   move your hand to - i.e. "conduct" - the ball's long bounces instead of emphasizing
   each pulse.

   With this step, you begin to internalize the pulses in your body too, with only
   auditory cues remaining. With sufficient practice, you'll be able to feel the
   four pulses without *needing* to move your hand to feel them.

6. You might need considerable practice with the previous stages before you can
   tackle this one - turn off the auditory cues as well! On Tala Keeper, you
   tap the pulse options till it looks like this - ![no auditory
   cues](/images/pulse-nosound-nobounce.png).  (If you're following this
   without Tala Keeper, [click here][3].)

   Now you're all on your own, with only the long bounces of the ball to help you
   feel the time. If you're using a tempo of 60bpm -- Tala Keeper will show "60"
   near its "floor" -- you have to fill in for the auditory and physical sensations
   for the three pulses between the major beats. That is all of 4 seconds between
   beats! If you're like me, you'll find that the mind has plenty of time to wander
   away from this simple task in that span of time. So this has been an excellent
   exercise in concentration for me.

   This stage is intense. There is an expansive long precise bounce of the ball
   "beating" once every 4 seconds or so (depending on the tempo). You are
   making these large gestures with your hand, while internally filling in for
   the three intermediate "knock" sounds for pulses between the major beats. All
   this while paying attention to your breathing. If youre still singing tones,
   that is fantastic and I salute you!

7. As the final step, close your eyes and turn off Tala Keeper, but continue
   everything else - i.e. following the breath, imagining the bounce, "conducting"
   using your hand and hearing the knock sounds internally.
   
   Congratulations! If you can keep this up for just a few minutes, turn on
   Tala Keeper and find you've not deviated much, you've taken a tremendous
   leap forward in your musical experience as a student. This should give you a
   taste of the level of concentration demanded of a full blown Carnatic
   musician during intense improvisatory sections of a performance.

## Comma

The exercise presented in this part 1 of the "how to practice Carnatic music
with a metronome" series gives you a taste of the process of internalizing
musical time. In the coming parts, I'll delve into progressively advanced
practice. However, the theme of this series will be the same - the
*internalization* of musical time, in several different contexts.

Happy practice!
