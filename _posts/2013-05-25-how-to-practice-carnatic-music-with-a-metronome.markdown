Internalizing the flow of musical time, known as "layam", is an essential
aspect of the training of a student of Carnatic music.  Though the adage "sruti
mata, laya pitah" ("pitch is the mother and time is the father") is oft
repeated, what we find in practice is that a reference for the sruti (tonic) is
recommended for and always used by even beginner students, but a comparable
reference for time in the form of a metronome is almost never seen.  

Many teachers recommend that students don't practice with a metronome because
of its "robotic" quality or because Carnatic music demands "flexible time".  I
could not reconcile this recommendation with the fact that many masters whose
sense of layam I admire have pacticed using a metronome. In my own experience
with personal veena practice as well as in group situations, I've noticed that
the difference between effective and counter productive practice with a
metronome is a subtle mental shift, which probably explains the polarized views
regarding metronomes. 

This article series is born out of a wish to share what I believe to be the
right mindset to adopt when practicing with a metronome, from the perspective
of a student. I will also consider various aspects of layam training in
Carnatic music and how they can be enhanced through practice with a metronome. 

I begin this series with "part 1" where I present a simple exercise to
demonstrate the usage of a metronome to internalize the flow of musical time in
a simple context. Though there is nothing specific to Carnatic music in part 1,
the notion of internalizing musical time and the meditative nature of the genre
are stood at the forefront. I expect them to be recurring themes in this
series, though I haven't worked it all out just yet.

## What is a metronome?

A metronome is a device that serves as a reference for musical time, much like
a clock is for physical time.  Common metronomes used in western classical
music training include the mechanical metronome which produces a periodic
ticking sound produced by a vertical pendulum, and the digital metronome that
can count beat groups of threes, fours, fives and such.  The digital metronomes
usually produce two sounds - one for the first beat of the group and another
for the remaining beats. 

You can read about [the various kinds of metronomes][metronomes] on Wikipedia,
so this article will not delve further into the details or history of the
device itself. The focus of this article is how to practice Carnatic music
using any one of them. If you are unfamiliar with a metronome, please do take
some time to go through the linked Wikipedia article.

## Tala Keeper

[Tala Keeper] is a metronome I designed considering the practice needs of
Carnatic music students - both beginner and advanced. So I'll be using Tala
Keeper to illustrate cases in this article. Though it is an iOS app, a
[browser-based simulator] is freely available if you don't own an iDevice.

[Click here][showsim] to show the in-browser simulator for playing the patterns
in this article. 

## Beginning at the beginning

The purpose of practicing Carnatic music with a metronome is to develop a
strong *internal* sense of the flow of musical time, or "layam".  This point is
central to practicing Carnatic music with a metronome. To put it differently,
the purpose of practicing with a metronome is not to gain its mechanical
precision, but to develop awareness and control over your internal sense of
time. 

One way to practice with a metronome is to treat it as a "master", continuously
defer to it and adjust to its beats during practice. This "turning outward"
attitude fosters a dependence on the metronome and if you practice this way,
you may feel lost without one. When it comes to difficult aspects of layam such
as nadai changes, you may also develop a false sense of being right because
you're continuously adjusting to the metronome's beats. This will manifest,
ironically, as a lack of confidence in whether you'll "get it right". If, like
me, you've been down this path, you may find yourself a tad nervous when
playing talam to a competent percussionist's solo.

A better attitude is to treat the metronome as a "friend" who walks alongside,
uncritical of your doings, but whose resources you can always draw on during
your practice to develop your own internal layam. In this way of "turning
inward", you do not adjust on every beat, because there is no "right timing" to
achieve. You let the beats drift past, fully confident that the difference
will be brought to your awareness by your "friend". Then you may stop, collect
yourself, and try again. Over time, you'll find yourself needing to stop less.
You'd have internalized your friend, and your confidence will grow.  Now when
you play talam for a percussion solo, you may actually be of help to the artist
because you'll understand what the artist is attempting to do. Instead of
nervousness, you'll feel pleasure!

The key to this internalization is attention to breathing, which will be
emphasized in this article. We all breathe naturally, but we do it so
automatically and without awareness that a simple question like "how many
breaths do you take in a minute?" can stump us. {" To truly practice Carnatic
music with a metronome is to turn your attention inward, to your breathing. "}
I now describe a simple starter exercise to give a taste of this "turning inward".
{% endpullquote %}

## A simple starter exercise

Here is a simple exercise involving breathing and basic tonal production that
most anyone can do, which can give a feeling for what it means to "turn inward"
in layam practice. I present instructions for Tala Keeper along the way, but
you can also play the patterns in the [simulator], or use a suitable metronome
of your choice.

1. Find a quiet spot, sit comfortably and play a simple left-right bounce
   pattern in Tala Keeper.  To do this, tap the pads in the following sequence
   -- left-middle-middle-middle-right-middle-middle-middle. Also make sure that
   the [pulse options] control looks like this - <img
   src="/images/pulse-sound-bounce.png"/>. ([Play this pattern now][1])
   
   A tempo of 60-70 beats per minute is a good starting point for this
   exercise. Your task is to pay attention to your breathing in relation to the
   bouncing ball.  Feel free to adjust the tempo a little to a value that you
   feel comfortable with. You may not have noticed it at this point, but with
   Tala Keeper, the process of internalization already began when you tapped
   out the sequence as indicated above.

   The purpose of this exercise is not to breathe synchronously with the
   bounces but to let your breathing proceed naturally, *while* you pay
   attention to *both* your breathing and the bounces.  If it so happens that
   your breathing synchronizes with the bounces now and then, that is alright
   too, but it is important that it happens naturally. When done right, this
   will quickly take you into a meditative state conducive for music practice.
   It will also give you a sense of what your "natural breathing" is, so that
   you can come back to it repeatedly during practice. 

2. After you've adjusted your breathing this way, sing a steady tone in
   "akaara" (a continuous "aah" vowel sound) at a pitch and volume level
   comfortable for you. Look for an effortless and soft tone. Do not concern
   yourself about your "sruti" at this point. Feel not only the duration of the
   note you produce but also the silence that follows during your inhalation,
   before the next note. Do not exert up to the very last ounce of your breath.
   A tone that feels like it is vibrating in your belly is ideal. When singing,
   you may want to choose a slightly higher tempo than your "natural" value to
   accommodate the extra breath effort required.

   At this point, every pulse is both audible as short knocking sounds as well
   as visible through the bouncing of the ball, so you can use this to engage
   both your auditory and visual senses.

3. Now feel this rhythm in your body by moving your hand like the bouncing
   ball. You can pretend to be a conductor waving his/her baton. You do not
   have to be exact, just imitate the way the timing feels using hand gestures.
   Feel free to experiment with subtle or exaggerated gestures.  Continue to
   attend to your breathing. Do this for as long as you feel like. 
   
   At this point, you're experiencing the flow of metric time in three modes -
   auditory, visual and kinesthetic - in an integrated way. 

4. Once you're satisfied with the previous phase, expand your consciousness of
   the four beat period by turning off visual hints of each pulse. If you're
   using Tala Keeper, you can tap the [pulse options] control till it looks
   like this - <img src="/images/pulse-sound-nobounce.png"/>. In this mode, the
   ball won't bounce in the middle for each pulse. The "knock" sound will
   continue to be heard. ([Play this pattern now][2])

   This is a first step towards internalizing the pulses. You now have auditory
   cues to which you can move your hands (both, or just one to start with) to
   feel the pulses, but you now have to imagine the movement of time between
   pulses. Don't concern yourself with "perfectly" landing on the knock sounds.
   The important part is that your attention is on your breathing and the
   steady passage of metric time.

5. Once you feel comfortable with using the auditory cue alone, shift your attention
   to the long bounce of the ball between major beats. The ball will now be doing
   one bounce for every four pulses. Again, pay attention to your breathing, but
   move your hand to - i.e. "conduct" - the ball's long bounces instead of emphasizing
   each pulse.

   With this step, you begin to internalize the pulses in your body too, with only
   auditory cues remaining. With sufficient practice, you'll be able to feel the
   four pulses without *needing* to move your hand to feel them.

6. You might need considerable practice with the previous stages before you can
   tackle this one - turn off the auditory cues as well! On Tala Keeper, you
   tap the pulse options till it looks like this - <img
   src="/images/pulse-nosound-nobounce.png"/>.  ([Play this pattern now][3])

   Now you're all on your own, with only the long bounces of the ball to help
   you feel the time. If you're using a tempo of 60bpm -- Tala Keeper will show
   "60" near its floor -- you have to fill in for the auditory and physical
   sensations for the three pulses between the major beats. That is all of 4
   seconds between beats! If you're like me, you'll find that the mind has
   plenty of time to wander away from this simple task in that seemingly short
   span of time. So this has been an excellent exercise in concentration for
   me.

   This stage can be intense. There is an expansive long precise bounce of the
   ball "beating" once every 4 seconds or so, depending on the tempo. You are
   making these large gestures with your hand, while internally filling in for
   the three intermediate "knock" sounds for pulses between the major beats.
   All this while paying attention to your breathing. If youre still singing
   tones, that is fantastic and I salute you!

7. As the final step, close your eyes and turn off Tala Keeper, but continue
   everything else - i.e. follow your breathing, imagine the bounce, "conduct"
   using your hand and hear the knock sounds within.
   
   Congratulations! If you can keep this up for just a few minutes, turn on
   Tala Keeper and find that you've not deviated much, you've taken a tremendous
   leap forward in your musical experience as a student. This should give you a
   taste of the level of concentration demanded of a full blown Carnatic
   musician during intense improvisatory sections of a performance.

## Comma

The exercise presented in this part 1 of the "how to practice Carnatic music
with a metronome" series gives you a taste of the process of internalizing
musical time. In the coming parts, I'll delve into progressively advanced
practice. However, I expect the theme of this series to be the same -- the
*internalization* of musical time -- with only the context changing.

Happy practice!
