Now that macworld is near, it is time for an iPad wish list.

I have only one item on it - and it is the addition of a wacom tablet-like
stylus interface on top of the capacitive touch screen. Camera? Nope don't
need. I want a pad where I can draw and scribble with precision, flipping the
stylus on its head to turn it into an eraser. Ah! That'll be a heaven of a
tablet with both touch and stylus support.
