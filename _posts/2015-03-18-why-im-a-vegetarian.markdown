Some years ago, I had a change of perspective on being vegetarian. The fact
that I am vegetarian was not the thing that changed, but it was the *why* that
did.

<!-- more -->

I found it odd that while the terms "vegetarian" and "non-vegetarian" gave a
somewhat clear definition in terms of what such a person eats, the reasons that
various vegetarians give on why they are vegetarians takes some form of "I
don't want to hurt/kill animals", leaving aside those who are vegetarian by
habit. The reason I found that odd is that while a vegetarian is someone who
eats veggies, *why* a vegetarian is so is expressed as what the person does
not do. I wanted to connect better with what I eat and I wanted a reason for
being vegetarian that did not involve referring to what I did not do.

To get started, watch the following clip, where Richard Feynman explains how
trees got their carbon. Nobody explains this better than Dr. Feynman!

So the substance of trees and plants got built up through the mechanism of
photosynthesis. Light from the sun provides the energy necessary to separate
Carbon atoms from Oxygen atoms in the CO2 in the air. The Oxygen is returned to
the air and the Carbon stays back in the plant. This is what plants do during
the day, and they do the reverse during the night, when so much light isn't
available. The reason they build up Carbon therefore is that the former process
happens just that bit more than latter. Plants don't need so much energy to
sleep during the night, and the convert the surplus daytime solar energy into
their material.

Realizing that changed me. Today, when I eat -- yes, practically *whenever* I
eat -- I think about where the energy I use comes from. To eat food and
immediately know that it came from light and air was (and is), for me, a
delightful way to connect to the  cosmos.  Not too far in the past, the energy
in this morsel came from a fusion reactor that's so far away that *light* takes
500 seconds to get here from there. It is also a connection across time,
because that light was created in the core of the sun from where it takes
[about 170,000 years][solar_core] to reach here. Then there is air, that earth
so delicately holds captive for us through her gravity.

So, for me, food isn't categorized into just two buckets, but is on a scale of
separation from the Sun. Plants are the closest, and of those, leaves feel
the closest since they are the very site where this wonderful transformation
takes place. Milk, eggs and such are one step removed and are as far as I'm
willing to go. Meat of herbivores is further away on the scale and the meat of
carnivores is even further away on that scale. 

I am vegetarian because I love and want to be as close to the sun and earth as
possible.
